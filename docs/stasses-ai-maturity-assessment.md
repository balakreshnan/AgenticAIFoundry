- Invest in team skills and tools

#### Quadrant 3: Execution & Scaling
**Position**: High Results & Impact, Low Strategy & Governance
**Focus**: "Scale existing AI initiatives and improve execution"
- Expand successful initiatives
- Improve operational efficiency
- Enhance execution capabilities

#### Quadrant 4: Results & Optimization
**Position**: High Results & Impact, High Strategy & Governance
**Focus**: "Focus on ROI measurement and responsible AI practices"
